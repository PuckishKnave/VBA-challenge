# VBA-challenge
The purpose of the VBA script (.bas and .vbs files) in this repository is to take stock data from a specific excel file and calculate yearly change, percent change, and total stock volume. The script should then output these calculations to a new column and loop through the rows until the stock data is processed for each worksheet in the excel file.
